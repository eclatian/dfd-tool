= Vicki Document Generators

This module produces the Vicki User Manual and Developer Guide.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to PDF and HTML5 by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn clean process-resources

Open the files _target/generated-docs/user-manual.html_ and _target/generated-docs/developer-guide.html_ in
your browser to see the generated HTML file.

The PDF format documentations would be produced at
_target/generated-docs/user-manual.pdf_ and _target/generated-docs/developer-guide.pdf_.
